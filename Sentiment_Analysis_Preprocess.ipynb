    "# Data pre-processing for sentiment analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of collecting the Valorant comment data from the YouTube API is to make it available for sentiment analysis. This sentiment analysis may be interesting to marketers, both of games and products targeted at gamers, streamers looking to improve their popularity or gaming companies seeking feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before processing the data for analysis we offer the option to parse the data by multiple variables:  Channel ID or Video ID. For this final dataset we are using Channel ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sources were referenced for determining the criteria and methods for data pre-processing for sentiment analysis:\n",
    "[Article 1](https://towardsdatascience.com/cleaning-preprocessing-text-data-for-sentiment-analysis-382a41f150d6), [Article 2](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-your-own-dataset-of-youtube-comments-39a1e57aade), [Article 3](https://neptune.ai/blog/tokenization-in-nlp).\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these sources, and our own determinations, this pre-processing takes the following steps:\n",
    "1. Remove Emojis\n",
    "2. Strip URLs\n",
    "3. Clean up HTML text\n",
    "4. Convert all text to lower\n",
    "5. Handle contractions (replace contractions with full words, i.e. you're >> you are)\n",
    "6. Strip remaining extra characters\n",
    "7. Remove stop words\n",
    "8. Lemmatization (defined per Article 1 as \"Lemmatization removes the grammar tense and transforms each word into its original form\") \n",
    "9. Tokenization\n"

In these months it happened to me 2 times in ranked and 4 times in dm (apparently people test cheats in dm from what I know, to then go to ranked.) and, by chance, in one of my last matches I met a cheater(I'm asc 3 and that could have been my game rank up for immortal, so imagine how much I tilted). Another thing I noticed, however, is that especially in High Elo there are cheaters, I don't know in low Elo.

In these months it happened to me 2 times in ranked and 4 times in dm (apparently people test cheats in dm from what I know, to then go to ranked.) and, by chance, in one of my last matches I met a cheater(I'm asc 3 and that could have been my game rank up for immortal, so imagine how much I tilted). Another thing I noticed, however, is that especially in High Elo there are cheaters, I don't know in low Elo.

They have some strats, but they are very simple like \"push B\" or \"push A\" that makes it somewhat difficult to predict as you don\\'t know their execution.Diamond - Ascendant: Good gameplay, has somewhat elaborate strats like \"I take mid\" \"Split A\" or \"I fake on B, go A\". When it comes to execution, they can execute (good execution if the players knew each other, decent if they don\\'t).Immortal - Radiant: High level gameplay, has elaborate strats that takes time and has synchronized executions which is difficult to counter.

He has no GOOD dome smokes (I’ll get to that later) and no mollies meaning he has no stalling capability and he’s useless on defense. His wave should not be a one charge ability. The wave is useless because why tf does the slow lasts a half second? The sight denial doesn’t save it he has a wall that he can use instead. Give it a second charge and increase the slow duration or give it a second debuff (maybe blind enemies who walk through it?)The barrier doesn’t have enough hp. It tanks a few vandal shots and then it disappears taking the smoke with it. Give it more hp and make it so that the smoke can actually stay the full duration so that he has some defensive capability.I like his wall and it’s versatility but why is it 12 seconds on a 40 second cooldown? Viper has a 20 second wall on a 20 second fuel recharge. Make his wall 20 seconds at the very least.His ult is also useless. Just hold a or d and you get out of the blast radius regardless of what you’re holding. You can be holding an Odin and still escape.

Three of my teammates started insulting me for instalocking Yoru, saying \"gg\", \"i will troll\", and even more offensive things, i had to mute them for the rest of the match. We lost 12-13. I almost was the MVP of the match (someone passed me for 9 combat points) and saved various rounds alone. On the other hand, the Harbor who most insulted me ended with 5/25, dying at all the start of the matches, and trolling in general. Man i hate that stupid people. If you gonna complain, complain if later i dont contribute to the team, but not before, creating a toxic and shitty ambient for the rest of the whole game. I swear that people like that need to be banned from the internet until they go to get some mental health care.Also edited for: #DownloadedBuff username: JaffarWolf',\n",

I keep going back and forth on how much I like it though because it can be entertaining asf for sure, but it also does feel too sweaty/focused sometimes and it would be fun to see them play more relaxed as well- doing plays they wouldn't usually do- using guns they're not used to- playing characters they're not familiar with/haven't used before- using their abilities more, etc. It just feels like because rounds are first to 14 (usually) as well, if every game is so focused/sweaty it's a little less enjoyable than it could be with them messing around too - the knife rounds are the only thing really bringing that aspect into the game currently (and Steve tbh), so it'd be great to see more like that.\",\n",

He should be an information gathering agent, where the enemy should always stay alerted if there is no information leaked about their position, as you are always alerted that Phoenix can blind you any second now. His cams are way to obvious, say, easy to hear and easy to spot by the blinking. I had exploited a sage wall to get the cam to a place where its of a great value, but despite the cam being so high...the enemies find that instantanously. Thats not the goal of a spy-cam. Cypher should be more like an agent where you continiously communicate with your team and not \"They are pushing B\" *cam gets destroyed*... Thats of no value, since the team anways needs time to reach that side. It\\'s not like enemies are looking for a possible cam, its more like enemies spontaneously destroy the cam after KNOWING there is one.

I did hope for the last minutes of the video a background music would still be available, but it didn’t. It’s b/c from my point of view without background music or at least sound/visual effects, that moment she clutched or killed the last person standing, it kind of seemed boring (there wasn’t enough engagement from her or the play that she’ll do to mask the serious/awkward silence?).I think background music and a few wacky sound/visual effects in funny or serious moments can help with the improvement of the quality of the videos. That way it can garner more views as it is more interesting and memorable. I hope if Syd sees this, it can answer her question as to why a couple of her vids might not be doing so well as she hoped.Overall good video and I’m only wishing for more to come! :3',\n",
