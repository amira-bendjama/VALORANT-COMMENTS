    "- Only verified channels, with a lower bound of subscription count of 100k, since the latter is how much the channel must reach in order to be eligible to apply for verification, and companies and brands will only consider verified channel to promote their products, in our case games.\n",
    "- Most valorant streamers are based on twitch, so a popular twitch streamers doesn’t qualify as a popular youtuber, so we picked valorant youtubers that upload on their main youtube channel and have a certain subscription count. \n",
    "- The valorant youtubers are split into two categories: Big youtubers above 500k subscription count, and small youtubers are under and above 100k. \n",
    "- Youtbers are english speakers from around the world, so it is not based on location but language.\n",
    "- Youtube channels are mixed between channels with only valorant videos, and channels with variety of other content besides valorant. Mainly to see the comment section through different communities. \n"
