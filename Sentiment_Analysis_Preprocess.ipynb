    "# Data pre-processing for sentiment analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of collecting the Valorant comment data from the YouTube API is to make it available for sentiment analysis. This sentiment analysis may be interesting to marketers, both of games and products targeted at gamers, streamers looking to improve their popularity or gaming companies seeking feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before processing the data for analysis we offer the option to parse the data by multiple variables:  Channel ID or Video ID. For this final dataset we are using Channel ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sources were referenced for determining the criteria and methods for data pre-processing for sentiment analysis:\n",
    "[Article 1](https://towardsdatascience.com/cleaning-preprocessing-text-data-for-sentiment-analysis-382a41f150d6), [Article 2](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-your-own-dataset-of-youtube-comments-39a1e57aade), [Article 3](https://neptune.ai/blog/tokenization-in-nlp).\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these sources, and our own determinations, this pre-processing takes the following steps:\n",
    "1. Remove Emojis\n",
    "2. Strip URLs\n",
    "3. Clean up HTML text\n",
    "4. Convert all text to lower\n",
    "5. Handle contractions (replace contractions with full words, i.e. you're >> you are)\n",
    "6. Strip remaining extra characters\n",
    "7. Remove stop words\n",
    "8. Lemmatization (defined per Article 1 as \"Lemmatization removes the grammar tense and transforms each word into its original form\") \n",
    "9. Tokenization\n"

In these months it happened to me 2 times in ranked and 4 times in dm (apparently people test cheats in dm from what I know, to then go to ranked.) and, by chance, in one of my last matches I met a cheater(I'm asc 3 and that could have been my game rank up for immortal, so imagine how much I tilted). Another thing I noticed, however, is that especially in High Elo there are cheaters, I don't know in low Elo.

In these months it happened to me 2 times in ranked and 4 times in dm (apparently people test cheats in dm from what I know, to then go to ranked.) and, by chance, in one of my last matches I met a cheater(I'm asc 3 and that could have been my game rank up for immortal, so imagine how much I tilted). Another thing I noticed, however, is that especially in High Elo there are cheaters, I don't know in low Elo.

He has no GOOD dome smokes (I‚Äôll get to that later) and no mollies meaning he has no stalling capability and he‚Äôs useless on defense. His wave should not be a one charge ability. The wave is useless because why tf does the slow lasts a half second? The sight denial doesn‚Äôt save it he has a wall that he can use instead. Give it a second charge and increase the slow duration or give it a second debuff (maybe blind enemies who walk through it?)The barrier doesn‚Äôt have enough hp. It tanks a few vandal shots and then it disappears taking the smoke with it. Give it more hp and make it so that the smoke can actually stay the full duration so that he has some defensive capability.I like his wall and it‚Äôs versatility but why is it 12 seconds on a 40 second cooldown? Viper has a 20 second wall on a 20 second fuel recharge. Make his wall 20 seconds at the very least.His ult is also useless. Just hold a or d and you get out of the blast radius regardless of what you‚Äôre holding. You can be holding an Odin and still escape. And in the off chance that it actually hits, it stuns them for 2 seconds. You cannot do anything in that time window.',\n",

I am not better either but I was coached also so I knew from my experience what helped me.

He should be an information gathering agent, where the enemy should always stay alerted if there is no information leaked about their position, as you are always alerted that Phoenix can blind you any second now.

I had exploited a sage wall to get the cam to a place where its of a great value, but despite the cam being so high...the enemies find that instantanously. Thats not the goal of a spy-cam. Cypher should be more like an agent where you continiously communicate with your team and not \"They are pushing B\" *cam gets destroyed*... Thats of no value, since the team anways needs time to reach that side.
